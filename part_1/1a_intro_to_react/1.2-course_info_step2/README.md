# Full Stack Open 2023

## Part 1: Introduction to React

### 1.2: Course Information, Step 1

#### TASK:

> Refactor the [Content component](../1.1-course_info_step1/src/App.js) so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead, it only renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

#### SOLUTION:

See [App.js](./src/App.js)

#### NOTES:

Technically, I did this for [1.1](../1.1-course_info_step1/README.md).

For this section I copied the entire node directory across - as it already contains the prescribed solution; and, I will go back and change the previous section to match the expectation.
