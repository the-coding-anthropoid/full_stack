# Full Stack Open 2023

## Part 1a: Introduction to React

### 1.1: Course Information, Step 1

#### TASK:

> Refactor the [code](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react#exercises-1-1-1-2) so that it consists of three new components: Header, Content, and Total. All data still resides in the App component, which passes the necessary data to each component using props. Header takes care of rendering the name of the course, Content renders the parts and their number of exercises and Total renders the total number of exercises.
>
> Define the new components in the file App.js.

#### SOLUTION:

See the [App.js](./1.1-course_info_step1_app.js) file for 1.1.

#### NOTES:

For my original solution I followed the methodology prescribed by [1.2](./1.2-course_info_step2.md); I have altered the methodology implemented in this section to conform to expectations.
