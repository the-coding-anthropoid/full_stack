## Part 1a: Introduction to React

### 1.2: Course Information, Step 1

#### TASK:

> Refactor the [Content component](./1.1-course_info_step1_app.js) so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead, it only renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

#### SOLUTION:

See the [App.js](./1.2-course_info_step2_app.js) for 1.2.

#### NOTES:

Technically, I did this for [1.1](./1.1-course_info_step1.md).

I have included that work here and changed the previous section to match the expectation.
