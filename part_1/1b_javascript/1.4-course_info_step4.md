# Full Stack Open 2023

## Part 1: JavaScript

### 1.4: Course Information, Step 4

#### TASK:

> Place the objects from 1.3 into an array as [shown](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/java_script#exercises-1-3-1-5). Modify the other parts of the application accordingly:

#### SOLUTION:

See the [App.js](./1.4-course_info_step4_app.js) for 1.4.

#### NOTES:

I should have read the whole task. I initially passed the objects as separate props - like [this](./1.4-course_info_step4_app_old.js) - rather than passing them directly as an array.
