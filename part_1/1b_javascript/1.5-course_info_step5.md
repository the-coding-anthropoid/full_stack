## Part 1: JavaScript

### 1.5: Course Information, Step 5

#### TASK:

> Further change the code from [1.4](./1.4-course_info_step4.md) to store the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

#### SOLUTION:

I can see two solutions that fix everything that breaks.

Firstly, one can change the return value of `App()` to pass the required part of the new object to each function - as shown [here](./1.5-course_info_step5a_app.js).

Or, alternatively, one can pass the entirety of the newly created object to each function and - like [this](./1.5-course_info_step5b_app.js). Changing the code of each function to parse the correct data from the object.

#### NOTES:

Although it does not specifically say, at least at this point, the first option seems preferable.

1. It fits better with the current methodological paradigm (within the given sequence it would be less error prone); &
2. I would imagine it is more efficient, rather than passing and processing unneeded data

However, as it was my first solution this may represent some bias on my part.

Nevertheless, for now, I will return the project App.js file to my initial version.
